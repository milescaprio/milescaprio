## Hey, I'm Miles!

### I'm a 16-year-old student at **Lincoln High School** in **Seattle, WA**.

I picked up programming when I was very young, starting with Mindstorms Ev3 when I was 5, and Scratch programming when I was 8. 

I'm now an avid coder who searches to make unique projects which are reflective of myself. I love programming because of the critical thinking, creative analysis, and innovation it's associated with.
