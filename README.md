## Hey, I'm Miles!

#### I'm a 17-year-old student, duel enrolled at Lincoln High School and North Seattle College in Seattle, WA.

I aspire to major in computer science and apply it to statistical research in varying fields.

I picked up programming when I was very young, starting with Mindstorms Ev3 when I was 5, and Scratch programming when I was 8. 

I'm now very passionate about coding, and spend a lot of my free time making projects about things important to me. I love programming because of its associated critical thinking, creative analysis, and innovation. I'm entirely self-taught, and have helped teach others.

I'm open to currently open internship positions: see my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miles-caprio-4622a326a/), [Resume](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AjPTAjzvct4lk7lKbGH8vc4Tth-GvQ?e=06nAbl), and [Detailed Programming Experience Summary]()
