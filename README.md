Hi, I'm Miles. I'm a 18-year-old incoming freshman at the University of Washington passionate about data science. I aspire to research the algorithmic and ethical architectures of Artificial Intelligence, including the philosophy behind its human-centered design, and the utilization of mathematical quantum computing to deploy stronger models. My journey stemmed from an early interest in programming, having started self-teaching when I was just five; later, coupled with my interests in mathematics, statistics, and philosophy, I decided this was the path through which I could make the greatest impact. I'm proficient in Python (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Sklearn Keras, TensorFlow), C++, Java, Rust, MATLAB, and R. I have also worked to teach many others how to code and demonstrate its wide variety of applications.
I'm open to currently open to work; see my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miles-caprio-4622a326a/), [Resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-9jfpluYej96UGq6ET-rB_O5LHyD0K72/view), and [Detailed Programming Experience Summary](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-263E7L9a2batdLYemZ_UW1aUpWbvZXT/view)
